# Release Checklist

So, you're releasing a game? What do you need? What should you have? Here's some guidelines.

*This is a live document, and as is the nature of just about everything in the RPG world, rules are never truly complete until a player or GM modify them at least a little bit.*

*Note: ashcans, pre-release and/or early-access models will definitely need to adapt this list*
